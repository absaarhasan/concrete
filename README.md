Test for front-end focused developers:

Overview

Build a small browser based application which uses GitHub's API to show the repositories for a given user.
The purpose of the task is for you to demonstrate your abilities on the front-end, so feel free to use whichever libraries and frameworks you are most comfortable with. We understand that skills are transferable. Note that we use Backbonewith both Marionette and Rivets but we can live with any other library you wish to present to us. Just be ready to talk about your choices.
Do as much or as little styling as you want. Bonus points for using a preprocessor or post processor.

Requirements
             The application should take GitHub usernames as input
             If one name is supplied, list the repositories belonging to that user, ordered by the number of stars on their own repos
             If two or more names are supplied, tell us who has the most stars on their own repos
             Add any additional info you think may be useful to see Notes
             We want to be able to start the application as easily as possible
             Feel free to show off with your code
             Be ready to talk about all aspects of your code - We're developers too, we just want to talk code
