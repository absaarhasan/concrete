He will ask them to mark themselves in such a way, that it leaves a very clear, and visible scar. Lucifer does not do this for his own benefit. He does this so that his victims have a permanent reminder of the pact they have made with him.</p>",

Lucifer is the Dark Lord, and he is a monster. He is the source of all evil, and he is absolutely horrific to behold. He is like nothing on this earth, and he is absolutely terrifying!</p>",

This is how people are first greeted as they arrive at the gates of Hell, and it is nothing but a taste of what is to come.</p>",
