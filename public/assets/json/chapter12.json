In many ways, it doesn&apos;t really matter what religion, or faith you may happen to subscribe to; most of the fundamental principles are all exactly the same.</p>",

      "screen": "<p>But we are all very limited creatures, and there will always be times when we are tempted to sin. Anyone can fall from grace, and this is truly not our fault. This is because we are only human at the end of the day, and there will always be times when temptation can get the better of us.</p>",

      "screen": "<p>We are susceptible to this because we are creatures of instinct. The same instincts that have seen us evolve from single-cellular life, are the same instincts that still drive us to this day. These instincts govern every last aspect of our lives, and they can often fill us with urges that are almost impossible to deny.</p>",

When we sin, God will punish us&mdash;he will punish us with with a sharp dose of hate. We find this punishing because there is nothing more beautiful than to have love in your heart, and there is nothing more excruciating than to have that taken away.</p>",

      "screen": "<p>And if we should choose to continue regardless, then God will simply punish us even further. He will blast us and blast us, with more and more hatred, until we finally give-up and obey. This is how God copes with us when we sin. He will diminish the love in our hearts until we correct ourselves, and relent to his will.</p>",

He will expel them from the body of God, and quite literally leave them to their own devices. This is what it means to be fallen angel, and this is what it means to fall from grace. This is what it means to be cast out of Heaven!</p>",

The simple truth is that these poor creatures may only have a few short weeks, or months to live. During which time, they will age very rapidly, and they will soon become very lifeless, and slow. Their bodies will grow decrepit, and weak, and they will very quickly lose all zest, and enthusiasm for life.</p>",

The idea is that they will cause less damage, this way.</p>",

In truth, it was probably his trickery that caused them to fall, in the first place!</p>",
